# CAP Theorem

The CAP theorem is fundamental to understanding distributed systems trade-offs.

During a network partition, a distributed system must choose between Consistency and Availability. Partition Tolerance is mandatory in distributed systems. You can have CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance) or AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance), but not all three simultaneously.
