# JavaScript Event Loop

This question tests your deep understanding of JavaScript's event loop, microtasks, and macrotasks.

The correct order is 1, 4, 3, 2 because:
- Synchronous code runs first (1, 4)
- Microtasks (Promises) run before macrotasks (setTimeout)
- So Promise (3) executes before setTimeout (2)
