questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Import Time Side Effects"
statement: "Code at module level in Python is executed when the module is first imported, which can cause side effects and impact import performance."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Python"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "Module-level code runs during import, which can cause side effects, slow imports, and create circular import issues. Best practice is to minimize module-level code and use if __name__ == '__main__' guards for script-specific code."
