questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Bytecode Optimization"
statement: "Python's peephole optimizer performs constant folding and other optimizations at compile time to improve bytecode efficiency."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Python"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "The peephole optimizer performs compile-time optimizations like constant folding (e.g., 2+3 becomes 5), constant unfolding for immutable collections, and elimination of dead code. These optimizations improve runtime performance without changing semantics."
