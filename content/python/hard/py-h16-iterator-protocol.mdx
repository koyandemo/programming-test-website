questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Iterator Protocol"
statement: "An iterator must implement both __iter__() and __next__() methods to conform to the iterator protocol."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Python"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "__iter__() returns the iterator object itself (usually self), and __next__() returns the next value or raises StopIteration when exhausted. This protocol allows objects to be used in for loops and other iteration contexts."
