questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Global Interpreter Lock"
statement: "The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython prevents multiple native threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Python"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "The GIL is a mutex that protects access to Python objects, preventing multiple threads from executing Python bytecode at once. This means CPU-bound multi-threaded programs don't benefit from multiple cores, though I/O-bound programs can still benefit from threading."

# Global Interpreter Lock

The GIL is a fundamental aspect of CPython's memory management that ensures thread safety but limits true parallel execution of Python code.
