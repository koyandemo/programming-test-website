questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Multiple Inheritance Diamond Problem"
statement: "Python's C3 linearization algorithm solves the diamond problem in multiple inheritance by ensuring each class appears only once in the MRO."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Python"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "The C3 linearization ensures that in the diamond problem (where a class inherits from two classes that share a common base), each class appears exactly once in the MRO, and the order respects the inheritance hierarchy while maintaining consistency."
