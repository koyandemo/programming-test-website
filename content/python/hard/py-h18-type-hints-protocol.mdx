questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Protocol Type Hints"
statement: "Protocol classes in Python's typing module enable structural subtyping (duck typing) with static type checking."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Python"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "Protocol classes define structural types based on method signatures rather than inheritance. A class satisfies a Protocol if it has the required methods, regardless of inheritance. This brings static typing to Python's duck typing philosophy."
