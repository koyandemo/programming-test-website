title: "Cyclic Garbage Collection"
statement: "Python's cyclic garbage collector can detect and collect reference cycles, but only for objects that don't have __del__() methods."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Python"
correctAnswer: false
explanation: "Modern Python (3.4+) can collect cycles even with __del__() methods. The gc module uses a generational garbage collector that can detect and break reference cycles. However, __del__() can still complicate collection in some cases."
