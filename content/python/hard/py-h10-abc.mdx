questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Abstract Base Classes"
statement: "A class that inherits from an ABC (Abstract Base Class) can be instantiated even if it doesn't implement all abstract methods."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Python"
correctAnswer: false
explanation: "Python's ABC module enforces that all abstract methods must be implemented before a class can be instantiated. Attempting to instantiate a class with unimplemented abstract methods raises a TypeError."

# Abstract Base Classes

ABCs provide a way to define interfaces and ensure subclasses implement required methods, enforced at instantiation time.
