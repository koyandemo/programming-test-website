title: "Weak References"
statement: "Weak references allow you to reference an object without preventing it from being garbage collected."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Python"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "Weak references (weakref module) create references that don't increase the reference count. This allows objects to be garbage collected even when weak references to them exist, useful for caches and avoiding circular references."
