questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Async Generators"
statement: "Async generators use 'async def' and 'yield' to produce values asynchronously, allowing await expressions within the generator."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Python"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "Async generators combine async functions with generators, using 'async def' and 'yield'. They can contain 'await' expressions and are iterated with 'async for'. This enables asynchronous iteration over data streams."
