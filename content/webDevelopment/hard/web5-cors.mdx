# CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

Understanding CORS is crucial for building secure web applications.

A preflight request is an OPTIONS request sent before the actual request to check if the CORS protocol is understood and if the actual request is safe to send. This happens for requests with certain methods (PUT, DELETE) or custom headers.
