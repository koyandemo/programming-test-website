questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Hash Join Optimality"
statement: "A Hash Join is typically the most efficient join algorithm for large relations when the smaller of the two relations is guaranteed to fit entirely in main memory."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Database"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "By building a hash table of the smaller relation in memory, a hash join can often perform the join in $O(N)$ average time complexity, which is generally faster than Sort-Merge Join or Nested-Loop Join for this scenario."
