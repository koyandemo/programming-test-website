title: "Lock Granularity vs. Concurrency"
statement: "Increasing the lock granularity (e.g., from row-level to table-level locking) generally leads to increased transaction concurrency but also higher resource overhead."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Database"
correctAnswer: false
explanation: "Increasing lock granularity **decreases** concurrency, as a lock on a large object (like a table) blocks more transactions than a lock on a small object (like a row)."
