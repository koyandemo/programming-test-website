questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Functional Dependency Closure Finiteness"
statement: "For any finite relational schema $R$, the closure of a set of functional dependencies ($F^+$) is also always a finite set."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Database"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "Since the set of attributes in the schema is finite, the total number of possible functional dependencies ($X \\to Y$) is also finite, thus the closure $F^+$ is finite."
