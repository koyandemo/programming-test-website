questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Array Covariance"
statement: "Java arrays are covariant, meaning if Dog extends Animal, then Dog[] is considered a subtype of Animal[], which can lead to a ArrayStoreException at runtime."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Java"
correctAnswer: true
explanation: "Java arrays are indeed covariant for backward compatibility, unlike generics. This design decision allows for runtime errors like ArrayStoreException if you try to insert an incompatible element into a supertype array that originally held a subtype."
