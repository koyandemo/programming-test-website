questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Static Method Overriding"
statement: "A subclass can successfully override a static method declared in its superclass, providing its own implementation that is invoked polymorphically at runtime."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Java"
correctAnswer: false
explanation: "Static methods cannot be overridden; they can only be hidden (or shadowed) by declaring a method with the same signature in the subclass. The method invoked depends on the reference type, not the object's actual type."
