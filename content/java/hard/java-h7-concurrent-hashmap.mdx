# ConcurrentHashMap Internals

Java 7 used segment-level locking (16 segments by default). Java 8+ uses CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations and synchronized blocks on individual nodes, allowing much higher concurrency. This fine-grained locking strategy enables multiple threads to read/write different parts simultaneously.
