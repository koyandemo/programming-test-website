questionType: "TRUE_FALSE"
title: "Synchronization and Atomicity"
statement: "While the volatile keyword guarantees visibility, an operation like i++ on a volatile integer variable is guaranteed to be atomic and thread-safe without further synchronization."
difficulty: "HARD"
category: "Java"
correctAnswer: false
explanation: "The i++ operation is not atomic; it involves three separate steps (read, increment, write). The volatile keyword only guarantees visibility of the write operation, not the atomicity of the compound operation."
