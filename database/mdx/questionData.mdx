    type: "CODING"
    title: "Two Sum Problem"
    description: "Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target."
    examples:
      - input: "nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9"
        output: "[0,1]"
        explanation: "Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]."
      - input: "nums = [3,2,4], target = 6"
        output: "[1,2]"
    constraints:
      - "2 <= nums.length <= 10^4"
      - "-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9"
      - "-10^9 <= target <= 10^9"

    starterCode:
      javascript: |

    title: "Reverse Linked List"
    description: "Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list."
    examples:
      - input: "head = [1,2,3,4,5]"
        output: "[5,4,3,2,1]"
      - input: "head = [1,2]"
        output: "[2,1]"

    type: "TRUE_FALSE"
    title: "Stack vs Queue"
    statement: "A stack follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, while a queue follows the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle."
    correctAnswer: false
    explanation: "This is backwards. A stack follows LIFO and a queue follows FIFO."

    description: "Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth."
    examples:
      - input: "root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]"
